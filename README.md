- Project scenario
```

    our group of Data experts would look at crime data and compare it to the Census data to find correlations and answer questions.

    We acted as a consulting group to help the US government look into the crime rate in the US and look for correlations with 
    Census demographics. 
    
    Looking at crime data from the FBI and the Census Bureau data from 2019, CPG Consulting will look for relationships 
    between crime rate and other factors such as household income, average age, level of education, unemployment rates, 
    and other economic indicators.

    These findings will be put into a final report with visualizations to aid the government in assessing what they can do 
    to potentially lower crime rates.
